_"the value doesn't fall far from its key"_

Facilitates text-based decision-making by talking to deciders alone and aggregating their opinions.

## Installation

If you want to install `requirements.txt` into poetry, use `poetry add $( cat requirements.txt )`. (Follow other poetry instructions too, this isn't magic.)

Put your OpenAI API key in `apikey.txt`. [Instructions for how to do this](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/).

Put your Discord bot token in `bot_token.txt`. For scope, select "bot"; for "bot permissions" select everything under "text permissions". (Idk if this is all necessary, but us devs may want to add stuff which uses any of those permissions later.)
